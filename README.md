# Swatch
A viewer/editor for ASE palette files.

# Building
Clone and run `cargo build`
The first build will take a hot minute as all the egui dependencies are pulled and built.

# Running
You can run with `cargo run` or place it somewhere on your path and run `swatch` or `swatch file.ase` to open a specific ASE. A few ASE files are included in this repository.

Lospec is a great place to find palettes in the ASE format: https://lospec.com/palette-list
